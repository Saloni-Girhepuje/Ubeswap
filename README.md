## Concept

The idea was the show the possibilities that ubeswap can open up- The Ubeverse.

The handcrafted artwork features a (blockchain) explorer who stands in front of the ubeswap logo. The main trunk of the logo acts as the portal/ gateway to the realm of ubeswap while the slice acts as the platform for our explorer to stand. The background depicts different realms of the ubeverse.

> The artwork displays a glimpse into the exploratory journey ahead to the holder.

### What it represents

- Invitation to explore
- Celebration of posibilities
- beginning/ tipping point of new journey


## Narrative

What happens when an explorer wants craves his own path? 

What happens when he refuses to be bound by the shackles of age-old institutions?

What happens when current *good enough* is not *good enough* for creators?

One steps into the unknown to look for those answers and unlock a new realm of possibilities.
